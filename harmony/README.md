### Requirenments

 - an Harmony Hub device
 - SmarthomeNG version >= 1.3
 - Python3 module <b>sleekxmpp</b>
  ```
  sudo pip3 install sleekxmpp
  ```

#### Device IDs and Commands

 Before you can start setting up your SmarthomNG items, you have to find out the ids of your configured Harmony Hub
 devices and their associated commands. Therefor you can use the script ```get_activities.py```. normally located under 
 ```/usr/local/smarthome/plugins/harmony```
 
 Execute this script like this:
 ```python3 get_activities.py -i HARMONY_HUB_IP -p HARMONY_HUB_PORT```
 
 If you want to save the output, you can redirect the stdout to a file:
 ```python3 get_activities.py -i HARMONY_HUB_IP -p HARMONY_HUB_PORT > /your/path/here.txt
 
 
 This is an example output:
 ```

### Setup plugin

 - Activate the plugin in your plugins.conf [default: /usr/local/smarthome/etc/plugins.conf]
 - Set the IP for your Harmony hub device 
 ```
 [harmony]
     class_name = Harmony
     class_path = plugins.harmony
     harmony_ip = 192.168.178.78 
     #harmony_port = 5222 # [default: 5222, int]
     #harmony_dummy_activity = 1234567 #  [default: None, int]
     #sleekxmpp_debug = false  #[default:false, bool]
 ```
 <p>
  
### Setup item
  
 To configure Harmony command(s) vou have to set an item as follows:
 
 ```
 [MyItem]
    type = bool
    enforce_updates = true
    harmony_command_0 = DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)|DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)| .... | .... | .... | ....
    harmony_command_1 = DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)|DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)| .... | .... | .... | ....
 ```
 
 **harmony_command_0_0|1**     [at least one required]<p>
 All plugin attributes are only valid for items with the type 'bool'. You have to set at least one of the attributes 
 <b>harmony_command_0</b> or <b>harmony_command_1</b>, both values together are valid too. If the item value is 
 'True', the command defined for harmony_command_1 will be triggered, harmony_command_0 vice versa.<p>

 As you can see the format of a **command** is always ```DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)|DEVICE_ID:COMMAND(:DELAY)```. The 
 delay parameter defines the time in seconds to wait before the next command will be triggered. This parameter is 
 optional (default: 0.2s) and can be omitted. You have to find out the right value by yourself since it heavily
 depends on your device. The maximum value is 60 (seconds).  
 You can group more than one commands together like this: ```COMMAND1 | COMMAND2 | COMMAND3```
 
### Limitations

 Only one set of commands can be triggered by the plugin simultaneously to avoid unpredictable behavior. 
 
### Real World Examples
 ```
 [[Shield]]
     type = bool
     harmony_command_1 = 42282391:PowerOn:6|42282391:InputBd
     harmony_command_0 = 42282391:PowerOff
 ```
 If the Item 'Shield' is set to True, the AV receiver is powered on and the and the input channel is set to 'Bluray' 
 after 6 seconds (the AV receiver is not instantly responsive after a power-on). 
 If the Item 'Shield' is set to False, the AV receiver is powered off.
 
 ```
    [[RTL]]
        type = bool
        harmony_command_1 = 42282391:InputSat/Cbl:0.2|31914808:3:0.3|31914808:Select
 ```
 This command sets the input channel of the AV receiver to SAT/Cbl, enters '3' and commits the input with 'Select'.
